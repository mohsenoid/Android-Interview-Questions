## How to Prepare for the Interview

Technical interviews can be quite challenging and stressful for both the candidates and the interviewers. It is completely normal to feel nervous before a job interview.

However, with the right preparation and mindset, you can help reduce your stress levels and perform your best. There are several things that you can do to help reduce your stress levels and feel more confident.

Here are some tips to keep in mind:


### Dos:

✔️ Ensure you get enough sleep the night before the interview. Being well-rested can help you feel more alert and focused during the interview.

✔️ Prepare for the interview by thoroughly researching the company, the role, and the interviewer(s). This will help you feel more prepared for the interview.

✔️ Practice Android coding problems and technical questions beforehand. This will help you feel more confident during the interview.

✔️ If possible, practice mock interviews with a friend or colleague to prepare for potential questions.

✔️ Dress appropriately and professionally.

✔️ Arrive early to the interview (whether it is a video call or at the office). This will give you time to relax and mentally prepare for the interview.

✔️ Take deep breaths and try to relax your muscles. This can help you feel more calm and centered.

✔️ Visualize yourself succeeding in the interview. This can help you feel more positive about the experience.

✔️ Remember that the interviewer is human, too (unless AI has taken the whole world!). They may be nervous or stressed as well.

✔️ Be honest about your skills and experience, no one should expect you to know everything!

✔️ Communicate your thought process and ask clarifying questions.

✔️ Ask questions about the company, the role, and the team. This will show that you're interested and engaged.

✔️ Follow up with a thank-you note or email.


### Don'ts:

❌ Don't memorize answers to common questions, and decide what to say and how to say it based on the interview flow.

❌ Don't be afraid to ask questions.

❌ Don't be late or unprepared.

❌ Don't be arrogant or dismissive, and instead be humble and respectful.

❌ Don't try to oversell yourself or pretend to be someone you're not.

❌ Don't get distracted easily (for instance thinking about the previous question) and forget to to listen and engage with the interviewer.

## Practice the STAR method

The STAR interview format is a behavioral interviewing technique employers use during hiring. “**STAR**” stands for **S**ituation, **T**ask, **A**ction, and **R**esult. 

The method is designed to bring a structured and focused approach to interviewing and primarily focuses on a candidate’s working styles, behavioral attributes, and competencies. 

STAR method interview questions usually focus on asking candidates for concrete examples of situations they’ve encountered in their past experiences – either in a work or educational setting. Questions typically start with phrases like “Describe a situation where,” “Tell me about a time you had to,” or “Share an example of when you.”

The best answers will include clear, concise information covering the following:

- **Situation**: The candidate describes the situation or context they were in, explaining the circumstances or challenges they faced.. 

- **Task**: The applicant explains the specific task(s) they had to achieve in the situation described. This helps the interviewer to better understand the candidate’s roles and responsibilities in the scenario. 

- **Action**: The candidate describes the actions they took or decisions they made to work through their tasks and goals – including how they overcame any specific challenges. This gives the interviewer insight into the candidate’s problem-solving abilities, working style, decision-making abilities, and more. 

- **Result**: The applicant defines the outcomes and results of their actions. These could be either positive or negative. They help show the interviewer the impact or value the candidate added to the task or how they rectified a negative outcome. This stage in the method provides an excellent opportunity for candidates to discuss any quantifiable impact they made – for instance, increasing sales by 2%.
