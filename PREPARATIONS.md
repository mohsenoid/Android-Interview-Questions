## How to Prepare for the Interview

Technical interviews can be quite challenging and stressful for both the candidates and the interviewers. It is completely normal to feel nervous before a job interview.

However, with the right preparation and mindset, you can help reduce your stress levels and perform your best. There are several things that you can do to help reduce your stress levels and feel more confident.

Here are some tips to keep in mind:

### Dos:

- ✔️ Ensure you get enough sleep the night before the interview. Being well-rested can help you feel more alert and focused during the interview.
- ✔️ Prepare for the interview by thoroughly researching the company, the role, and the interviewer(s). This will help you feel more prepared for the interview.
- ✔️ Practice Android coding problems and technical questions beforehand. This will help you feel more confident during the interview.
- ✔️ If possible, practice mock interviews with a friend or colleague to prepare for potential questions.
- ✔️ Dress appropriately and professionally.
- ✔️ Arrive early to the interview (whether it is a video call or at the office). This will give you time to relax and mentally prepare for the interview.
- ✔️ Take deep breaths and try to relax your muscles. This can help you feel more calm and centered.
- ✔️ Visualize yourself succeeding in the interview. This can help you feel more positive about the experience.
- ✔️ Remember that the interviewer is human, too (unless AI has taken the whole world!). They may be nervous or stressed as well.
- ✔️ Be honest about your skills and experience, no one should expect you to know everything!
- ✔️ Communicate your thought process and ask clarifying questions.
- ✔️ Ask questions about the company, the role, and the team. This will show that you're interested and engaged.
- ✔️ Follow up with a thank-you note or email.


### Don'ts:

- ❌ Don't be afraid to ask questions.
- ❌ Don't be late or unprepared.
- ❌ Don't be arrogant or dismissive, and instead be humble and respectful.
- ❌ Don't try to oversell yourself or pretend to be someone you're not.
- ❌ Don't get distracted easily (for instance thinking about the previous question) and forget to to listen and engage with the interviewer.
